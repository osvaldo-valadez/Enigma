# Enigma
Recreation of the World War 2 Enigma Machine

This project involves building a simulator for a generalized version of this machine (which itself had several different versions.) Your program will take descriptions of possible initial configurations of the machine and messages to encode or decode (the Enigma algorithms were reciprocal, meaning that encryption is its own inverse operation.)

The Enigmas effect a substitution cipher on the letters of a message. That is, at any given time, the machine performs a permutation—a one-to-one mapping—of the alphabet onto itself. The alphabet consists solely of the 26 letters in one case
